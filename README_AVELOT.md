// Core Functions
- enter(uint256 amount)      // Enter lottery with DAI deposit
- exit(uint256 roundId)       // Withdraw deposit from past rounds
- claim(uint256 roundId)      // Winner claims the prize
- getRound(uint256 roundId)   // Get round information
- getTicker(uint256 roundId, address user) // Get user's ticket
```
