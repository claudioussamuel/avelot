# Football Betting Pool Redesign

## Overview
Transformed AveLot from a general lottery system to a **football match betting pool** where users bet on match outcomes and winners share the prize pool proportionally.

## New Concept

### How It Works
1. **Match Selection**: Users browse upcoming football matches
2. **Place Bets**: Choose prediction (Home Win, Draw, or Away Win) and bet amount
3. **Pool Formation**: All bets go into a shared pool, divided by prediction type
4. **Match Result**: After the match, the winning outcome is determined
5. **Prize Distribution**: Winners share the total pool proportionally based on their stake

### Example Payout
- **Total Pool**: 10,000 DAI
- **Winning Team Pool**: 4,000 DAI (40% of bettors)
- **Your Bet**: 100 DAI (2.5% of winning pool)
- **Your Winnings**: 250 DAI (2.5% of total pool = 2.5x return)
