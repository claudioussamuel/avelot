# Color Scheme Update - Professional Design

## Overview
Replaced the AI-typical purple-pink gradient scheme with a more professional, muted color palette.

## New Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Slate/Gray**: Main brand color (slate-700 to slate-900)
  - Used for: Logo, primary buttons, main hero background, countdown timers
  - More professional and less "AI-generated" looking

### Accent Colors
- **Blue** (blue-600 to blue-700): Active states, secondary actions
- **Cyan** (cyan-600 to cyan-700): Tertiary highlights, statistics
- **Emerald** (emerald-500 to emerald-600): Success states, winnings, positive actions
- **Amber** (amber-400 to amber-600): Winner badges, achievements

### Background Animations
- Replaced purple/pink/indigo blobs with blue/cyan/slate
- Reduced opacity from 20% to 10% for subtlety

## Design Philosophy

### Before (AI-typical)
- Vibrant purple-pink gradients everywhere
- High saturation colors
- Typical of AI-generated designs
- Less professional appearance

### After (Professional)
- Muted slate/gray as primary
- Strategic use of blue/cyan for accents
- Lower saturation, more sophisticated
- Corporate/fintech aesthetic
- Better suited for DeFi applications

## Benefits

1. **More Professional**: Looks like a real fintech product
2. **Better Contrast**: Easier to read, better accessibility
3. **Less Distracting**: Focus on content, not flashy colors
4. **Industry Appropriate**: Matches DeFi/crypto aesthetic
5. **Timeless**: Won't look dated as quickly

## Color Usage Guidelines

- **Slate**: Primary brand, main actions, headers
- **Blue**: Secondary actions, active states
- **Cyan**: Tertiary highlights, statistics
- **Emerald**: Success, positive outcomes, winnings
- **Amber**: Achievements, winners, special highlights
- **Gray**: Neutral backgrounds, borders, disabled states
